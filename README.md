# Better Tooltip
WoW - Addon - Change behavior of tooltip.

Download and unzip to your WoW Addon folder. (..\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns)
Rename folder "BetterTooltip-master" to "BetterTooltip".

## Addon changes tooltip by:
| Action | Behavior | 
| --- | --- |
| Mouseover an Player | Shows tooltip bottom right, slighty fade out, mouse over this tooltip let them stay visible |
| Mouseover anything else | Shows tooltip at cursor, immidiatly hide if object no longer under cursor, a bit more transparent than other tooltips |
| Infight | no tooltips in 3D world, only on user interface |

## Setup
Open BetterTooltip.lua in your addon folder.
Edit the offest attributes like you want it.
Check ingame how u like it.

## Disclaimer:

This addon is very simple and very effective.
I will not do any special development for ingame menu setup because this needs a fully internationalisation
and I realy dont want to waste my time on that.
